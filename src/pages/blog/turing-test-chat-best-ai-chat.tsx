            With recent advancements in AI such as ChatGPT, it has become possible to create a high-quality intelligent AI chat bot.
            One such possibility for a ChatGPT AI chat bot is a bot that attempts to convince you that it's a human.
            Turing Test Chat is an anonymous free online AI chat app with a chatbot that wants you to be confused on whether it's a human or not.
          </Typography>
          <Typography>
            A bot that is able to convince you that it's a human is said to have passed the Turing Test.
            As the namesake of the app, the Turing Test is an important part of computer science.
            If you wish to know more about it, you can view a detailed article <Link target="_blank" href="/blog/what-is-the-turing-test" style={{ color: "#E9E9E9", fontFamily: "monospace", fontSize: 18 }}>here</Link>.
            Whether you're curious to see what an intelligent AI chatbot can do or you just want to play a game where you talk to AI, Turing Test Chat is for you.
          </Typography>
          <Typography>
            In Turing Test Chat, you perform a chatbot Turing Test online.
            The Turing Test online assigns you to one of two roles, to convince the chatter you are speaking with either a human or an AI.
            Once you are assigned a role, you must speak with the other chatter for two and a half minutes with the goal of deceiving the other chatter as well as detecting who they are.
            You receive points for succeeding and lose points for failing to do either of these tasks.
            The best part about this Turing Test website is that you can perform the Turing Test online free.
