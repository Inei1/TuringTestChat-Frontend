            With the recent craze of ChatGPT, there are many new and unique websites where you can talk to an AI chatbot.
            In this blog post, I'll cover some of the more interesting and unique AI chat bots online.
            Some of these are chatbot games online, while others are a website to talk to AI.
            All of the websites on this list are AI chat sites where you can talk to an AI robot online.

            Unsurprisingly, I'm going to promote Turing Test Chat as #1 :).
            Turing Test Chat is a unique upcoming chat website where you essentially perform the <Link href="/what-is-the-turing-test" style={{ color: "#E9E9E9", fontFamily: "monospace", fontSize: 18 }}>Turing Test</Link> with ChatGPT.
            You will be assigned to chat with another person or with a bot, and then you indicate if you think the other person was a human or a bot.
            You can learn more about Turing Test Chat <Link href="/blog/turing-test-chat-best-ai-chat" style={{ color: "#E9E9E9", fontFamily: "monospace", fontSize: 18 }}>Here</Link>.

            As the website that started this AI craze, ChatGPT is still one of the best AI chatting websites around.
            ChatGPT's use of natural language processing, its versatility, and its effective use of contextual understanding make it better than most alternatives.
            As an AI chat bot, ChatGPT provides the greatest variety of chat options compared to other entries on this list.
            You can ask ChatGPT almost anything, and it will usually give good responses.
            Best of all, ChatGPT is a completely free online AI you can talk to.

          <Typography variant="h2" sx={{ fontSize: 22, mt: 5 }}>3. <MuiLink href="https://beta.character.ai/" style={{ color: "#E9E9E9", fontFamily: "monospace", fontSize: 22 }}>Character AI</MuiLink></Typography>

          <Typography>
            Character AI is a website to talk to AI where users create a character which can then be spoken to.
            Quality of the AI you can chat with is variable due to the nature of it being user generated.
            If you want to make a AI chat bot online free, then Character AI might be a good option for you.
            Be warned that Character AI has a moderately strict filter on not-safe-for-work (NSFW) content.
            Character AI is a AI chat free online for anyone who wants to speak to a character from their favorite media.

          <Typography variant="h2" sx={{ fontSize: 22, mt: 5 }}>4. <MuiLink href="https://aidungeon.io/" style={{ color: "#E9E9E9", fontFamily: "monospace", fontSize: 22 }}>AI Dungeon</MuiLink></Typography>

          <Typography>
            Instead of being a website where you directly talk with a chatbot, AI Dungeon creates a text-based adventure game around your prompts.
            With its use of chat AI, you will be able to create dynamic interactive stories on the fly.
            AI Dungeon can work as your own personal DnD dungeon master (minus the combat).
            The always free tier of AI dungeon offers plenty of entertainment, and the paid tiers will offer you a better experience.

          <Typography variant="h2" sx={{ fontSize: 22, mt: 5 }}>5. <MuiLink href="https://novelai.net/" style={{ color: "#E9E9E9", fontFamily: "monospace", fontSize: 22 }}>Novel AI</MuiLink></Typography>

          </Container>
          <Typography>
            Novel AI is similar to AI dungeon in that it generates a story around you instead of being a direct website chat AI.
            As mentioned on their website, you can talk to an AI robot for help in "authorship, storytelling, virtual companionship, or simply a GPT powered sandbox for your imagination."
            It also offers some image generation to help with visualizing the stories.
            The biggest downside to Novel AI is that it's not free.
            There is a free trial tier, and other tiers range from $10-$25 per month.

            Chai is similar to Character AI in that it allows users to create and chat with AI chat bots.
            While other similar talk to AI websites often have many filters, Chai does not.
            This makes Chai the best web chat AI for NSFW chatbots.
            Chai is free to use, although there are limits to the number of messages you can send unless you pay.

          <Typography>
            Replika is one of the older chat with AI bots sites online, being publically available in 2017.
            The purpose of Replika is to create a persistent companion chatbot.
            Unfortunately Replika's age means that its responses are sometimes unconvincing, but it's still a good option for a persistent chatbot.
            In 2023, Replika added a filter to prevent users from using it for romantic or NSFW features.
            Replika is free, with the option to pay for more features.

          <Typography>
            EndlessVN is another web chat AI which generates a story around you.
            What makes in unique is that it's focused on generating an AI <MuiLink>visual novel</MuiLink>.
            It generates "graphics, music, story and characters" as you play.
            As it focuses on being a game first, EndlessVN is specialized to provide an entertaining AI to chat with.
            EndlessVN is in open alpha and is free to use, with options to pay for more features.
